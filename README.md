# Chocolate

Use the .jar file in the root to run. You need java installed. Run with `java -jar Chocolate-assembly-0.0.1.jar temp.choco`

## Building it yourself

You need sbt installed. Run `sbt bloopInstall`, then you can use `sbt "run temp.choco"` to run, or to create a .jar file, `sbt assembly`.
